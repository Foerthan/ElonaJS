Is the Heretical Forest, whose roots spread and eat away our lands, not exactly that?

The name of the first, I think, need not be mentioned. The two princes were as different as light and shadow. The warlike Clyne was naturally successful, while his brother who lived in his shadow was a failure.",

He was a pacifist and did much to help the disadvantaged and those that were orphaned by the war. Among these, he took a particular interest in the ' Heretical' Elea and their Forest. While Clyne amused himself with hunting and socializing, the younger boy devoted himself to studying the Forest. Hope, after all, is something born of ignorance. Perhaps it was that he saw something of himself in the Heretical Forest. By eliminating the prejudice and suspicion regarding the Forest, and by exploring a path of coexistance with the Elea, he believed the world might change...",

He couldn't accept that the world was at its core an unkind and unfair place where the strong rule over the weak. He began to begrudge his brother who continuously rose in power, all the while cursing himself for being born an albino and hating the world that refused to change its ways... And then, he met an angel.",

As he watched her live a strong life in Zanan which is notoriously cruel to her kind, he once again saw a part of himself in the Elea.",

Having struggled his entire life to not be a burden on others, it was the first time the boy felt powerful and free. And yet in that moment, in his lust to deny and overturn the values of his brother whom the world viewed as a success, he abandoned himself. His pacifism, his compassion for the poor, his affection for the weak, all of the morals he touted - he betrayed them all and became nothing more than a tool for the power he had despised all his life.",

But could he truly deny everything he once was? His past self that was so ugly and weak? Could he honestly turn his head, pretending that the pain and conflict that he and others had experienced each and every day did not exist? It was the very means by which I affimed myself that also took away my ability to accept the world. Morals, values, emotions... What had I left to believe in? But don't misunderstand. I am not attempting to garner your sympathy by making it appear that I am unhappy or feel regret.",
      "dialogue_4": "Why tell me your story, then? To be honest, the choices you have defined for yourself appear as simple deception to me. Could that boy from the past who preached compassion towards the weak truly accept becoming such an ugly person as you are now? I won't say that I don't understand your pain. But having been rejected by the world - No, I should say having turned your back on it - and running from a life you felt incomplete, wishing nothing but pain and hatred upon yourself... I can't help but wonder if you're using this things to fill the emptiness in your heart.",
      "dialogue_5": "You say you had nothing left to believe in, but I  feel that potential still lies within your heart. I think you have decided that some things are undeserving of love, and that you yourself are one of them. But I think that relationships can be built with methods others than hatred and insincerity.",
      "dialogue_6": "...How surprising. It is once again a young Elean girl that offers me the light known as hope as I drown within the darkness of my despair. But I'm afraid that the time where that may have been useful has passed. If nothing else, I now understand that if such a thing as good will existed within this world that there may have yet been another path for me. For that, at least, I am grateful.",
      "dialogue_7": "...Ah yes, I promised to tell you the secret of the Forest, didn't I? As you thought, the Ether Wind and the Forest's expansion are not the calamity known as the 'Meshera'. Meshera is... a bacteria, so to speak, that devours all life. It all but perished once during the era of Rehm-Ido, but has risen again with the advent of Sierra Terre. Or perhaps I should say that Sierra Terre is Meshera itself. The World-Devouring Giants live within me, within you, within all living creatures.",

      "dialogue_9": "I can't spoil the fun by giving everything away, now can I? I'll answer your question as strictly as I can. The reason that we can exist is due to the Heretical Forest. Were the Forest to be destroyed, all life on Irva would disappear, though whether it would take a single year or a hundred I cannot say. Fufu. 'Heretical Forest' is such an ironic name. It is we who are the true heretics of this world.",
      "dialogue_10": "Now it's only a matter of time before the Vindale Forest is destroyed by human hands. When everything that the people of the world believe in collapses, when they learn the truth too late to reverse their actions, what do you think will become of the world? I, for one, am looking forward to finding out.",
      "dialogue_11": "This is absurd. While I could sympathize with your background, how could you escalate a personal issue to one of life and death for the entire world?",

They blamed her for an illness that had been spreading throughout the ship, and consequently, no orphanage would take her in.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was standing in front of her and holding her hand.",

They show no hesitation in using the weak as stepping stones... And I was no different. Knowingly or not, whether they resisted or not, I harmed many people. I was an arrogant and ruthless man.",

Even in the eyes of children, a person like me who had left Ateran was nothing but a piece of trash... Of course, they didn't actually feel that way. I was terrorizing myself by projecting my own way of thinking onto others. It wasn't until that moment that I realized just how ugly and totally devoid of humanity I was.",

But regardless of any efforts I made to find inner pieace, even when I otherwise kept myself engaged, the part of me that had been trained in Ateran sneered at how pathetic I was, tempting me to return. Even now I doubt I've fully separated myself from the values that place instilled in me. I fought that side of myself for many years, and in the end, I had nothing but a feeling of emptiness and a desire to erase everything about myself. That's why I left home.",

All across the nation various communities were joined by the idea of mutual cooperation with each other and harmony with nature.",

Rather than being a close-knit community, 'Yutasu' was simply a generic term for those who lacked the ability to fit in with the other communities. Those who couldn't form close bonds with others, those with abnormal desires, those who preferred solitude, those without morals, materialists... Anyone who didn't fit in with the other communities was named Yutasu, and while it wasn't visible on the surface, they were detested by society.",

Rehm-Ido had highly advanced biochemistry, and Ether proved to be a valuable resource that provided a chemical change to a variety of medicines.

And the Yutasu were the greatest land holders. Through the process of 'Star Harvesting', the Yutasu regained their injured self-esteem and found their place in the society of Rehm-Ido. It was for this reason that, despite knowing it was coming, they averted their eyes from the creeping threat of the Meshera...",

With the rampant collection of Ether, the forests were left easy prety for the Meshera.

And after many years, after the vast knowledge and culture of the previous human civilization had been lost, the Vindale Forest lived up to its name.",
      "dialogue_2": "A massive immune reaction arose from the Forest, becoming a wind that raged across the world. Indeed, this is what we now know as the Ether Wind. The Ether Wind enhanced the natural immunity of the plant life that had been infected by the Meshera, massively weakening the Meshera infection. The Vindale Forest which produced the Ether Winds and the outside world where the Meshera had been weakened slowly began to differ from one another. That is the environment present in Irva now.",
